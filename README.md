# Project Overview

This project reinforces the concept of test-driven development, which is a programming practice that is super useful in today's development world. Testing is an important skill that allows for a developer to ensure that each piece of code has been tested to be "foolproof" in the case of any errors, exceptions, etc. 

In this project, Jasmine was used to write a number of tests for the Feed Reader application. These tests focus on the underlying business logic of the application as well as DOM manipulation and event handling.

#How to Run The Application

In order to run the Feed Reader application, please open up the project directory and enter the **dist** folder, which contains the optimized version of the source code. 

Open up **index.html** in the browser of your choice to run the application. 

You will find the Jasmine test results at the bottom of the application.
